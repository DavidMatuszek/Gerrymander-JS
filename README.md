# Gerrymander-JS
This is a toy gerrymandering program.

WHY:
Voting districts are determined by the party in power, and are designed to keep them in power. Both political
parties do this, given the opportunity. The use of computers to gerrymander districts has made the practice
far more effective than ever before. This toy program is designed to demonstrate how gerrymandering works to
disenfranchise people. 

HOW:
I wrote this program initially in Processing/Python. It is now in p5.js, which is Javascript with the
Processing library. I'm not great at Javascript, so please forgive the Python flavor! Also, coding
suggestions welcome!

HOW YOU CAN HELP:
Gerrymandering is undeniably unfair and undemocratic; but, alas, that's politics. (It's currently illegal to
gerrymander based on race, but that's the only exception, and not always easy to prove.) I'd like to believe
that the more people understand gerrymandering, the more likely it is to be made illegal. So if you agree,
please share this program with your friends.
